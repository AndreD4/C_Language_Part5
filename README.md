 # Expression and statements
 Expressions

 An expression is:

  - The most basic building block of a program.

  - "a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation'

  - Computes a value from a number of operators.

  - There is much, much more to expressions - not necessary at this level.

# Expressions - Examples

       34                           //literals
       favourite_number             // variable
       1.5 + 2.8                    // addition
       2 * 5                        // multiplication
       a > b                        // relational
       a = b                        // assignment

Statements

A statement is:

  - A complete line of code that performs some action.

  - Usually terminated with a semi-colon

  - Usually contain expressions

  - C++ has many types of statements

    * express, null, compound, selection, iteration, declaration, jump, try blocks, and other.
   
 # Statement - Examples

        int x;                          // declaration
        favourite_number = 12;          // assignment
        1.5 + 2.8;                      // expression
        x = 2 * 5;                      // assignment
        if (a > b) cout << "a is greater than b";  // if;
  

# Using Operators
* C++ has a rich set of operators

  - unary, binary, ternary

* Common operators can be grouped as follow:

  - assignment
 
  - arithmetic
 
  - increment/decrement
 
  - relational
 
  - logical
 
  - member access
 
  - other
