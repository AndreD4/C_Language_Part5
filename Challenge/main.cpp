    Write a program that asks user to enter the following:
    An integer representing the number cents
    
    
    You may assume that the number of cents entered is greater than or equal zero
    
    the program should then display how to provide that change to the user
    
    in the US:
        1 dollar is 100 cents
        1 quarters is 25 censt 
        1 dime is 10 cents 
        1 nickel 5 cents 
        and 
        1 penny is 1 cent
    
    Here is a sample run:
    
    Enter an amount in cents: 92
    
    You can provide this change as follow:
    dollars : 0
    quarters : 3 
    dimes : 1
